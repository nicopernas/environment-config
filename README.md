environment-config
==================

Small project to keep track of all my environment configurations.
I share these between my work environment (Linux) and home (MacOSX).

Here you can find bash settings, vim preferences and all sort of
weird and not-so-useful scripts.

I normally clone this repo in a hidden folder like `$HOME/.env-config` and
then symlink all the local settings files to here or source them from within
the local `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`.
